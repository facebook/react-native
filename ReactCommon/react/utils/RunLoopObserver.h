   * The concept of an owner.
   * A run loop observer normally observes a run loop running on a different
   * thread. That implies that this other thread (the run loop thread) will call
   * methods of this class owned by some other thread. To make it safe, we need
   * to ensure that at the moment of the calling the observer still exists. To
   * do so, we use an owner object (a weak pointer) that must retain (possibly
   * indirectly) the observer. The platform-specific code should convert the
   * weak pointer (owner) to a strong one right before calling the observer,
   * ensuring the safety of calling; right after the call, the strong pointer
   * should be safely released.
   *
   * Note, in the case when the pointer to the actual owner will be available
   * later, only after calling the constructor of the class, the caller can
   * create a dummy pointer beforehand and then merge it (using
   * `shared_ptr<X>(shared_ptr<Y> const &, X *)`) with the actual one (sharing
   * the control block).
