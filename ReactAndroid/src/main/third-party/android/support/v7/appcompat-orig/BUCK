# This is a bit messy and hopefully a temporary thing
# The problem is that Gradle extracts appcompat resources into app namespace, com.facebook.react
# While BUCK behaves properly and extracts them into android.support.v7.appcompat package.
# We want to support both Gradle and BUCK builds so we hack a bit how BUCK extracts resources.
# Besides that we still need JAVA classes from appcompat-v7.aar, that is why rn_android_library
# extracts classes.jar but the trick is that we can't take full appcompat.aar because resources
# extracted from it by BUCK would conflict with resources we use under Gradelified package
# All this mumbo jumbo will go away after t10182713
