# @react-native/eslint-plugin-monorepo

This is a private package that contains ESLint rules for `react-native` itself.
They are configured in the `.eslintrc.js` at the repository root.

For ESLint rules intended for projects that consume React Native, add them to
the `@react-native-community/eslint-plugin` package instead.
