### Changed

- **API:** `NewAppScreen` no longer internally handles device safe area, use optional `safeAreaInsets` prop (aligned in 0.81 template) ([732bd12dc2](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/732bd12dc21460641ef01b23f2eb722f26b060d5) by [@huntie](https://github.com/huntie))
- **Animated:** Animated now always flattens `props.style`, which fixes an error that results from `props.style` objects in which `AnimatedNode` instances are shadowed (i.e. flattened to not exist in the resulting `props.style` object). ([da520848c9](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/da520848c931f356d013623c412af11dce7ff114) by [@yungsters](https://github.com/yungsters))
