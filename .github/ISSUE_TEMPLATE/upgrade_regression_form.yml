        Please use this form to file an issue if you have upgraded or are upgrading to [latest stable release](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/releases/latest) and have experienced a regression (something that used to work in previous version).

        If you're **NOT** upgrading the React Native version, please use this [other bug type](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml).

        Before you continue:
        * If you're using **Expo** and having problems updating it, [report it here](https://github.com/expo/expo/issues).
        * If you're found a problem with our **documentation**, [report it here](https://github.com/facebook/react-native-website/issues/).
        * If you're having an issue with **Metro** (the bundler), [report it here](https://github.com/facebook/metro/issues/).
        * If you're using an external library, report the issue to the **library first**.
        * Please [search for similar issues](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues) in our issue tracker.

        Make sure that your issue:
        * Have a **valid reproducer** with an [empty project from template](https://github.com/react-native-community/reproducer-react-native).
        * Is upgrading to the [**latest stable**](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/releases/) of React Native.

        Due to the extreme number of bugs we receive, we will be looking **ONLY** into issues with a reproducer, and on [supported versions](https://github.com/reactwg/react-native-releases#which-versions-are-currently-supported) of React Native.
