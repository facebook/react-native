        Thank you for taking the time to report an issue for React Native, your contribution will help
        make the framework better for everyone.

        Before you continue:
        * If you're using **Expo** and you're noticing a bug, [report it here](https://github.com/expo/expo/issues).
        * If you're found a problem with our **documentation**, [report it here](https://github.com/facebook/react-native-website/issues/).
        * If you're having an issue with **Metro** (the bundler), [report it here](https://github.com/facebook/metro/issues/).
        * If you're using an external library, report the issue to the **library first**.
        * Please [search for similar issues](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues) in our issue tracker.

        Make sure that your issue:
        * Have a **valid reproducer** (either a [Expo Snack](https://snack.expo.dev/) or a [empty project from template](https://github.com/react-native-community/reproducer-react-native).
        * Is tested against the [**latest stable**](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/releases/) of React Native.

        Due to the extreme number of bugs we receive, we will be looking **ONLY** into issues with a reproducer, and on [supported versions](https://github.com/reactwg/react-native-releases#which-versions-are-currently-supported) of React Native.
