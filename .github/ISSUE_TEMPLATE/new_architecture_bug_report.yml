        Thank you for taking the time to report an issue for [the New Architecture of React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/the-new-architecture/landing-page),
        your contribution will help make the framework better for everyone.

        If you're **NOT** using the New Architecture, please use this [other bug type](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml).
        Do not attempt to open a bug in this category if you're not using the New Architecture as your bug will be closed.

        Make sure that your issue:
        * Have a **valid reproducer** (either a [Expo Snack](https://snack.expo.dev/) or a [empty project from template](https://github.com/react-native-community/reproducer-react-native).
        * Is tested against the [**latest stable**](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/releases/) of React Native.

        Due to the extreme number of bugs we receive, we will be looking **ONLY** into issues with a reproducer, and on [supported versions](https://github.com/reactwg/react-native-releases#which-versions-are-currently-supported) of React Native.
