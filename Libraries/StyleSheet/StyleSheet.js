/**
 * A StyleSheet is an abstraction similar to CSS StyleSheets
 *
 * Create a new StyleSheet:
 *
 * ```
 * var styles = StyleSheet.create({
 *   container: {
 *     borderRadius: 4,
 *     borderWidth: 0.5,
 *     borderColor: '#d6d7da',
 *   },
 *   title: {
 *     fontSize: 19,
 *     fontWeight: 'bold',
 *   },
 *   activeTitle: {
 *     color: 'red',
 *   },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Use a StyleSheet:
 *
 * ```
 * <View style={styles.container}>
 *   <Text style={[styles.title, this.props.isActive && styles.activeTitle]} />
 * </View>
 * ```
 *
 * Code quality:
 *
 *  - By moving styles away from the render function, you're making the code
 *  easier to understand.
 *  - Naming the styles is a good way to add meaning to the low level components
 *  in the render function.
 *
 * Performance:
 *
 *  - Making a stylesheet from a style object makes it possible to refer to it
 * by ID instead of creating a new style object every time.
 *  - It also allows to send the style only once through the bridge. All
 * subsequent uses are going to refer an id (not implemented yet).

   * var styles = StyleSheet.create({
   *   listItem: {
   *     flex: 1,
   *     fontSize: 16,

   *
   * StyleSheet.flatten([styles.listItem, styles.selectedListItem])

   * Alternative use:
   * ```
   * StyleSheet.flatten(styles.listItem);
   * // return { flex: 1, fontSize: 16, color: 'white' }
   * // Simply styles.listItem would return its ID (number)
   * ```
   * This method internally uses `StyleSheetRegistry.getStyleByID(style)`
   * to resolve style objects represented by IDs. Thus, an array of style
   * objects (instances of StyleSheet.create), are individually resolved to,
   * their respective objects, merged as one and then returned. This also explains
   * the alternative use.
