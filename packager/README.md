# metro-bundler

🚇 The JavaScript bundler for React Native.

- **🚅 Fast**: We aim for sub-second reload cycles, fast startup and quick bundling speeds.
- **⚖️ Scalable**: Works with thousands of modules in a single application.
- **⚛️ Integrated**: Supports every React Native project out of the box.

This project was previously part of the [react-native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) repository. In this smaller repository it is easier for the team working on Metro Bundler to respond to both issues and pull requests. See [react-native#13976](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/13976) for the initial announcement.
