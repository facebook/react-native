# @react-native/jest-preset

Jest presets for [React Native](https://reactnative.dev) applications.

## Usage

### Installation

Install `@react-native/jest-preset` in your app:

with `npm`:

```sh
npm i @react-native/jest-preset --save-dev
```

or with `yarn`:

```sh
yarn add -D @react-native/jest-preset
```

### Configuring Jest

Then, create a file called `jest.config.js` in your project's root directory. Then load this preset:

```
module.exports = {
  preset: '@react-native/jest-preset',
};
```

You can further customize your Jest configuration by specifying other options. See [Jest's `jest.config.js` documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration) to learn more.

### Migration Note

This Jest preset used to be part of the core `react-native` package and accessible at `react-native/jest-preset.js`. As long as `@react-native/jest-preset` is installed, `react-native/jest-preset.js` will be aliased to this package and continue to work but is deprecated.

Follow the installation instructions above to migrate to `@react-native/jest-preset` and change `preset: 'react-native'` to `preset: '@react-native/jest-preset` to migrate.
