Minitest 5:

* 4 deaths in the family:

  * Added Minitest::Runnable. Everything minitest can run subclasses this.

    * Your benchmarks need to move to their own subclass.
    * Benchmarks using the spec DSL have to have "Bench" somewhere in their describe.

  * Added a refute (was deny) for every assert.
  * Added capture_io and a bunch of nice assertions from zentest.
  * Added deprecation mechanism for assert_no/not methods to test/unit/assertions.
  * Added pp output when available.
  * Added tests for all assertions. Pretty much maxed out coverage.
  * Added tests to verify consistency and good naming.
  * Aliased and deprecated all ugly assertions.
  * Cleaned out test/unit. Moved autorun there.
  * Code cleanup to make extensions easier. Thanks Chad!
  * Got spec args reversed in all but a couple assertions. Much more readable.
  * Improved error messages across the board. Adds your message to the default.
  * Moved into Mini namespace, renamed to Mini::Test and Mini::Spec.
  * Pulled the assertions into their own module...
  * Removed as much code as I could while still maintaining full functionality.
    * Moved filter_backtrace into MiniTest.
    * Removed MiniTest::Unit::run. Unnecessary.
    * Removed location_of_failure. Unnecessary.
    * Rewrote test/unit's filter_backtrace. Flog from 37.0 to 18.1
  * Removed assert_send. Google says it is never used.
  * Renamed MiniTest::Unit.autotest to #run.
  * Renamed deny to refute.
  * Rewrote some ugly/confusing default assertion messages.
  * assert_in_delta now defaults to 0.001 precision. Makes specs prettier.

* 9 bug fixes:

  * Fixed assert_raises to raise outside of the inner-begin/rescue.
  * Fixed for ruby 1.9 and rubinius.
  * No longer exits 0 if exception in code PRE-test run causes early exit.
  * Removed implementors method list from mini/test.rb - too stale.
  * assert_nothing_raised takes a class as an arg. wtf? STUPID
  * ".EF" output is now unbuffered.
  * Bunch of changes to get working with rails... UGH.
    * Added stupid hacks to deal with rails not requiring their dependencies.
    * Now bitch loudly if someone defines one of my classes instead of requiring.
  * Fixed infect method to work better on 1.9.
  * Fixed all shadowed variable warnings in 1.9.
