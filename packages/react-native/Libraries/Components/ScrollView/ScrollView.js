/*
 * iOS scroll event timing nuances:
 * ===============================
 *
 *
 * Scrolling without bouncing, if you touch down:
 * -------------------------------
 *
 * 1. `onMomentumScrollBegin` (when animation begins after letting up)
 *    ... physical touch starts ...
 * 2. `onTouchStartCapture`   (when you press down to stop the scroll)
 * 3. `onTouchStart`          (same, but bubble phase)
 * 4. `onResponderRelease`    (when lifting up - you could pause forever before * lifting)
 * 5. `onMomentumScrollEnd`
 *
 *
 * Scrolling with bouncing, if you touch down:
 * -------------------------------
 *
 * 1. `onMomentumScrollBegin` (when animation begins after letting up)
 *    ... bounce begins ...
 *    ... some time elapses ...
 *    ... physical touch during bounce ...
 * 2. `onMomentumScrollEnd`   (Makes no sense why this occurs first during bounce)
 * 3. `onTouchStartCapture`   (immediately after `onMomentumScrollEnd`)
 * 4. `onTouchStart`          (same, but bubble phase)
 * 5. `onTouchEnd`            (You could hold the touch start for a long time)
 * 6. `onMomentumScrollBegin` (When releasing the view starts bouncing back)
 *
 * So when we receive an `onTouchStart`, how can we tell if we are touching
 * *during* an animation (which then causes the animation to stop)? The only way
 * to tell is if the `touchStart` occurred immediately after the
 * `onMomentumScrollEnd`.
 *
 * This is abstracted out for you, so you can just call this.scrollResponderIsAnimating() if
 * necessary
 *
 * `ScrollView` also includes logic for blurring a currently focused input
 * if one is focused while scrolling. This is a natural place
 * to put this logic since it can support not dismissing the keyboard while
 * scrolling, unless a recognized "tap"-like gesture has occurred.
 *
 * The public lifecycle API includes events for keyboard interaction, responder
 * interaction, and scrolling (among others). The keyboard callbacks
 * `onKeyboardWill/Did/*` are *global* events, but are invoked on scroll
 * responder's props so that you can guarantee that the scroll responder's
 * internal state has been updated accordingly (and deterministically) by
 * the time the props callbacks are invoke. Otherwise, you would always wonder
 * if the scroll responder is currently in a state where it recognizes new
 * keyboard positions etc. If coordinating scrolling with keyboard movement,
 * *always* use these hooks instead of listening to your own global keyboard
 * events.
 *
 * Public keyboard lifecycle API: (props callbacks)
 *
 * Standard Keyboard Appearance Sequence:
 *
 *   this.props.onKeyboardWillShow
 *   this.props.onKeyboardDidShow
 *
 * `onScrollResponderKeyboardDismissed` will be invoked if an appropriate
 * tap inside the scroll responder's scrollable region was responsible
 * for the dismissal of the keyboard. There are other reasons why the
 * keyboard could be dismissed.
 *
 *   this.props.onScrollResponderKeyboardDismissed
 *
 * Standard Keyboard Hide Sequence:
 *
 *   this.props.onKeyboardWillHide
 *   this.props.onKeyboardDidHide
