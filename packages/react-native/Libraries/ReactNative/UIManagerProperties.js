/**
 * The list of non-ViewManager related UIManager properties.
 *
 * In an effort to improve startup performance by lazily loading view managers,
 * the interface to access view managers will change from
 * UIManager['viewManagerName'] to UIManager.getViewManagerConfig('viewManagerName').
 * By using a function call instead of a property access, the UIManager will
 * be able to initialize and load the required view manager from native
 * synchronously. All of React Native's core components have been updated to
 * use getViewManagerConfig(). For the next few releases, any usage of
 * UIManager['viewManagerName'] will result in a warning. Because React Native
 * does not support Proxy objects, a view manager access is implied if any of
 * UIManager's properties that are not one of the properties below is being
 * accessed. Once UIManager property accesses for view managers has been fully
 * deprecated, this file will also be removed.
