/**
 * Use this annotation to annotate properties of native views that should be exposed to JS. This
 * annotation should only be used for setter methods of subclasses of {@link
 * com.facebook.react.uimanager.ViewManager}.
 *
 * <p>Each annotated method should return {@code void} and take exactly two arguments: first being a
 * view instance to be updated and second a value that should be set.
 *
 * <p>Allowed types of values are:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>primitives (int, boolean, double, float)
 *   <li>{@link String}
 *   <li>{@link Boolean}
 *   <li>{@link com.facebook.react.bridge.ReadableArray}
 *   <li>{@link com.facebook.react.bridge.ReadableMap}
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>When property gets removed from the corresponding component in React, annotated setter will be
 * called with {@code null} in case of non-primitive value type or with a default value in case when
 * the value type is a primitive (use appropriate default field of this annotation to customize
 * default value that is going to be used: {@link #defaultBoolean}, {@link #defaultDouble}, etc.)
 *
 * <p>Since in case of property removal for non-primitive value type setter will be called with
 * value set to {@code null} it's required that value type is annotated with {@link Nullable}.
 *
 * <p>Note: Since boolean property type can be represented both as primitive and wrapped default
 * value set through {@link #defaultBoolean} is only respected for primitive type and for the
 * wrapped type {@code null} will be used as a default.
