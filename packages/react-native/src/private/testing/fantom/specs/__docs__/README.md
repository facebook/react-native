# Fantom

[🏠 Home](../../../../../../../../__docs__/README.md)

This directory contains the specifications for internal native modules used by
Fantom. These are not meant to be consumed directly.

> [!NOTE]
>
> These definitions are here (in the `react-native` package) and not in the
> `@react-native/fantom` package just for convenience, to reuse the same codegen
> configuration we already have (that is configured to look for definitions in
> `src/`).
