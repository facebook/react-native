# RFC: Swift Package Manager Support for React Native iOS

## Summary

Add Swift Package Manager (SPM) as an officially supported build system for
React Native iOS apps, alongside CocoaPods. The approach uses **prebuilt
XCFrameworks** published to Maven, eliminating the need for source compilation
of React Native internals and enabling fast, reproducible builds.

## Basic example

### New project

```bash
npx react-native init MyApp
cd MyApp/ios
open MyApp-SPM.xcodeproj
# Build and run from Xcode — no pod install, no Ruby toolchain
```

A future CLI integration (e.g., an `--ios-build-system spm` flag on
`react-native init`) could run `setup-ios-spm.js --init` automatically as part
of project creation.

### Existing project

```bash
cd MyApp/ios
node ../node_modules/react-native/scripts/setup-ios-spm.js --init
# CocoaPods setup continues to work — both can coexist
open MyApp-SPM.xcodeproj
```

After initial setup, day-to-day development requires no extra commands. Adding
or removing JS dependencies that include native code is handled automatically
by a build-phase sync step (see [Auto-sync build phase](#auto-sync-build-phase)).

## Motivation

### Apple is moving away from CocoaPods

SPM is Apple's endorsed dependency manager. Xcode's SPM integration improves
with every release — package resolution, build caching, and IDE features all
assume SPM as the primary workflow. CocoaPods is community-maintained and has
been officially sunsetted — the CocoaPods trunk will become permanently
read-only on **December 2, 2026**, after which no new pods or updates can be
published ([announcement](https://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-Specs-Repo/)).
Existing builds will continue to work, but the ecosystem is moving on.

### Build speed

Prebuilt XCFrameworks skip compilation of ~2000 C++/Objective-C files. A clean
SPM build of rn-tester compiles only app sources and codegen output. This is a
significant improvement for CI pipelines and developer iteration speed.

### Reduced onboarding friction

CocoaPods requires Ruby, Bundler, and a working gem environment — a frequent
source of setup issues, especially on new machines or in CI. SPM requires only
Xcode. Removing the Ruby toolchain dependency simplifies onboarding and reduces
the surface area for environment-related build failures.

### Adoption barrier

Many organizations mandate SPM for iOS dependencies. Teams in these
environments are currently blocked from adopting React Native, or must maintain
custom workarounds. First-class SPM support might help overcoming this barrier.

### Compatibility

CocoaPods continues to work during the transition period. The SPM workflow
generates a separate `AppName-SPM.xcodeproj` that coexists with the existing
Pods-based project. Teams can migrate at their own pace before CocoaPods trunk
goes read-only in December 2026.

```

### Pipeline

`setup-ios-spm.js` orchestrates five steps:

| # | Step | Script | Output |
|---|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Codegen | `generate-codegen-artifacts.js` | `build/generated/ios/` |
| 2 | Autolinking | `spm/generate-spm-autolinking.js` | `autolinked/Package.swift` + source symlinks |
| 3 | Download | `spm/download-spm-artifacts.js` | Cached xcframeworks |
| 4 | Package | `spm/generate-spm-package.js` | `build/xcframeworks/Package.swift` + symlinks |
| 5 | Xcodeproj | `spm/generate-spm-xcodeproj.js` | `AppName-SPM.xcodeproj` |
| — | Sync (build-time) | `spm/sync-spm-autolinking.js` | Re-runs steps 1–4 when inputs change (downloads artifacts if missing) |

When run with `--init`, the script also appends SPM-specific entries to the
project's `.gitignore` (e.g., `autolinked/`, `build/generated/ios/`,
`build/xcframeworks/`, `.build/`, `Package.resolved`). Entries that already
exist are not duplicated. This ensures generated artifacts are not accidentally
committed.

### Auto-sync build phase

After initial setup, developers shouldn't need to re-run `setup-ios-spm.js`
manually when dependencies change. The generated `.xcodeproj` includes a
**Sync SPM Autolinking** pre-build phase (ordered first, before VFS overlay)
that:

1. Checks whether xcframework artifacts are missing (`artifacts.json` or
   `React.xcframework` absent). This covers fresh clones where no setup
   script has been run yet.
2. Compares timestamps of `package.json`, `react-native.config.js`, and the
   `node_modules` directory against `autolinked/.spm-sync-stamp`. In
   monorepos where `node_modules` is hoisted, the parent directory is also
   checked.
3. If any check triggers (or the stamp is missing): sources `with-environment.sh`
   for node PATH, then runs `spm/sync-spm-autolinking.js` which re-executes
   codegen, artifact download (if needed), autolinking, and package generation.
4. If all inputs are fresh: exits immediately (~1ms shell check).

Failures emit `warning:` and exit 0 — the existing autolinking may still be
valid. The stamp file is written on successful sync.

The sync step handles React Native version changes automatically: after
`npm install` pulls a new version, the `node_modules` mtime changes, the sync
step regenerates autolinking and recreates xcframework symlinks pointing to the
new version's cache directory.

The sync step is **self-healing**: if xcframework artifacts are missing (e.g.,
the local cache at `~/Library/Caches/com.facebook.ReactNative/` was deleted,
or the project was freshly cloned), it automatically downloads them before
proceeding with autolinking and package generation. This means `setup-ios-spm.js`
is only strictly required for initial project scaffolding (`--init`); subsequent
builds recover automatically.

### Cleaning generated SPM state

Xcode's "Clean Build Folder" (Cmd+Shift+K) only removes DerivedData — it does
not touch the project's `build/`, `autolinked/`, or `.build/` directories.
Xcode provides no hook to run custom scripts during GUI clean actions.

To fully reset SPM state, run:

```bash
node setup-ios-spm.js --clean
```

This removes `build/xcframeworks/`, `build/generated/ios/`, `autolinked/`, and
`.build/`, then re-runs the full setup (codegen, download, autolinking, package
generation). After it completes, open the `.xcodeproj` in Xcode and build.

The `--clean` flag performs a full re-setup rather than just deleting files
because SPM package resolution is locked for the duration of a build — if only
stubs were left in place, Xcode would resolve stubs and never pick up the real
packages generated by the sync build phase.

### Stub packages for fresh clones

Xcode resolves SPM packages **before** any build phase runs. On a fresh clone,
the referenced package directories (`build/xcframeworks`, `autolinked`,
`build/generated/ios`) may not exist yet, causing package resolution to fail.

To solve this, `generate-spm-xcodeproj.js` writes **stub `Package.swift`
files** into each referenced sub-package directory that doesn't already have
one. Each stub defines the expected library products backed by a minimal
placeholder target (`.stub/Stub.swift`). This lets Xcode resolve packages
successfully even before the first build. On the first build, the auto-sync
build phase overwrites the stubs with real Package.swift files generated from
downloaded artifacts and autolinking output.

### Caching and CI

Xcframeworks are cached at
`~/Library/Caches/com.facebook.ReactNative/spm-artifacts/{version}/{flavor}/`
by default. The download step accepts a `--output` flag to write xcframeworks
to an explicit directory.

For CI pipelines (GitHub Actions, CircleCI, etc.), cache the default path
keyed by the React Native version and flavor to avoid re-downloading
xcframeworks on every build.

The Maven base URL can be overridden via the `ENTERPRISE_REPOSITORY`
environment variable for teams that mirror artifacts to an internal registry.

**Planned:** A `RN_SPM_CACHE_DIR` environment variable to override the default
cache directory. This is not yet implemented in the current POC but is needed
for CI environments where a specific path must be persisted across builds.

### Package graph

SPM resolves three local packages as dependencies of the app target:

```
AppName-SPM.xcodeproj
  └── Package.swift (app root — committed, user-owned)
        ├── build/xcframeworks/Package.swift
        │     ├── ReactNative (product, wraps React binaryTarget)
        │     ├── ReactNativeDependencies (binaryTarget)
        │     └── hermes-engine (binaryTarget)
        ├── build/generated/ios/Package.swift
        │     ├── ReactCodegen (target — codegen output)
        │     └── ReactAppDependencyProvider (target)
        ├── autolinked/Package.swift
        │     └── <AutolinkedModule>... (targets — symlinked sources)
        └── build/generated/ios/ (codegen source path)
```

The root `Package.swift` is generated once (`--init`) and committed. Developers
can customize it — add dependencies, adjust settings, or add new targets.
Subsequent runs only regenerate the sub-packages (`autolinked/` and
`build/xcframeworks/`).

Both `Package.swift` and `AppName-SPM.xcodeproj` are generated once during
`--init` and committed. This is typically done by project scaffolding tools
(`react-native init`, `expo init`) rather than by developers manually. After
initial generation, these files are user-owned — subsequent `setup-ios-spm.js`
runs (without `--init`) only regenerate the sub-packages, not the root
`Package.swift` or `.xcodeproj`. Teammates can clone the repo and open Xcode
immediately — stub packages allow package resolution to succeed, and the
auto-sync build phase downloads artifacts and handles autolinking on the first
build.

### Header resolution

React Native uses CocoaPods-style imports (`#import <React/RCTBridge.h>`) that
SPM does not natively support. Two mechanisms solve this:

1. **XCFramework `Headers/` layout.** The prebuild step organizes headers by
   `header_dir` (e.g., `Headers/React/`, `Headers/react/renderer/core/`).
   Adding `-I Headers` to search paths resolves most imports directly.

2. **VFS overlay.** A Clang virtual filesystem overlay (`React-VFS.yaml`)
   remaps remaining edge cases — headers that appear in multiple pods or have
   platform variants. The overlay is generated as a template at prebuild time
   and resolved with local paths at setup time.

### Local native modules

Modules not discovered via autolinking (e.g., app-specific native modules) are
declared in `react-native.config.js`:

```js
// react-native.config.js
module.exports = {
  spmModules: [
    {
      name: 'MyNativeModule',       // SPM target name
      path: 'ios/MyNativeModule',   // path to source files
      exclude: ['*.podspec'],       // files to exclude from the target
      publicHeadersPath: '.',       // header search path for consumers
    },
  ],
};
```

Each entry becomes a target in `autolinked/Package.swift`. Sources outside the
autolinked directory are mirrored with **file-level symlinks** (SPM rejects
directory symlinks that resolve outside the package root).

### Third-party library support

The current implementation handles React Native's own frameworks and app-local
native modules. The primary goal for third-party libraries is to **build using
SPM**. Shipping prebuilt xcframeworks is the recommended approach for faster
builds, but it is not a requirement — libraries can also be compiled from
source via SPM targets. This ensures that library authors with limited
resources can support SPM without needing to set up a prebuild CI pipeline.

#### Library metadata in `react-native.config.js`

`react-native.config.js` is the canonical place for library SPM metadata. The
autolinking pipeline already scans `node_modules` for this file to discover
iOS and Android native modules. Adding SPM config alongside the existing
`dependency.platforms.ios` keeps a single source of truth, requires no new
discovery mechanism, and can express things `Package.swift` cannot — such as
Maven URL templates with version and flavor placeholders for downloading
prebuilt xcframeworks. Libraries may still ship a `Package.swift` for direct
SPM consumers outside the React Native ecosystem, but React Native autolinking
reads `react-native.config.js`.

#### Prebuilt xcframeworks (primary path)

React Native already prebuilds its core into xcframeworks and publishes them to
Maven. This is the model we want every library to follow. Libraries declare SPM
metadata in `react-native.config.js`:

```js
// react-native-maps/react-native.config.js
module.exports = {
  dependency: {
    platforms: {
      ios: { /* existing autolinking config */ },
    },
  },
  spm: {
    // Primary: prebuilt xcframework (downloaded at setup time)
    xcframework: {
      name: 'ReactNativeMaps',
      // URL template — {version}, {rn-version}, {flavor} resolved at download time
      url: 'https://maven.example.com/.../react-native-maps-{version}-xcframework-{flavor}.tar.gz',
    },
    // Fallback: source compilation (used during local development or when
    // xcframework is unavailable)
    source: {
      name: 'ReactNativeMaps',
      path: 'ios',
      publicHeadersPath: '.',
      exclude: ['*.podspec', 'Tests/**'],
      dependencies: ['MapKit'],
      resources: ['ios/Resources/**'],
    },
  },
};
```

**Planned (Phase 2):** When `setup-ios-spm.js` gains third-party library
support, it will:
1. If `spm.xcframework` is declared, download the prebuilt binary (fast path).
2. If the download fails or the `--source` flag is passed, fall back to
   `spm.source` and compile from symlinked sources.
3. If neither is declared, the library requires a manual `spmModules` entry.

Currently, only `spmModules` entries (see [Local native modules](#local-native-modules))
are supported. The `spm.xcframework` and `spm.source` config fields — including
the `dependencies` field shown above — are not yet implemented.

#### Source compilation (fallback)

Source-level autolinking (`spmModules` / `spm.source`) remains available for:
- **Local development** — library authors iterating on native code
- **Libraries without prebuilt xcframeworks** — transitional state
- **App-specific native modules** — code that lives in the app repo

This reuses the existing `spmModules` mechanism: sources are mirrored with
file-level symlinks into `autolinked/`, compiled as SPM targets with
appropriate header search paths.

#### `react-native-prebuild` CLI

React Native already has a mature prebuild pipeline (`scripts/ios-prebuild/`)
that produces signed, packaged xcframeworks published to Maven. Rather than
asking library authors to reinvent this, we can expose the same tooling as a
reusable CLI:

```bash
npx react-native-prebuild \
  --podspec ios/MyLibrary.podspec \
  --react-native-version 0.80.0 \
  --platforms ios,ios-simulator \
  --flavor release \
  --output dist/

# Output:
# dist/MyLibrary.xcframework.tar.gz
# dist/MyLibrary.framework.dSYM.tar.gz
```

The tool would:

1. **Download React Native xcframeworks** for the specified version.
2. **Parse the library's podspec** to discover source files, headers,
   `header_dir`, dependencies, and compiler flags.
3. **Generate a temporary Package.swift** declaring the library as a target
   with dependencies on the RN xcframeworks.
4. **Build** using `xcodebuild` for each platform slice.
5. **Compose** the xcframework with organized headers, module map, and
   optional VFS overlay.
6. **Sign** the xcframework with the developer's code signing identity.
7. **Package** as `.tar.gz` with dSYM symbols.

The tool includes code signing as a built-in step. Library authors provide
their own signing identity (Apple Developer certificate); the tool handles
the `codesign` invocation. Unsigned xcframeworks trigger macOS Gatekeeper
warnings, so signing is strongly recommended for distributed artifacts.
Documentation will cover how to create and manage a signing identity for
this purpose.

Library authors can integrate this into CI to publish prebuilt artifacts on
every release, targeting a matrix of React Native versions and build flavors.

#### Version compatibility

A library's xcframework must be built against a compatible React Native
version. The prebuild tool embeds metadata (React Native version, library
version, build flavor, minimum iOS version) inside the xcframework. The
download step verifies compatibility at setup time, warning if a library was
built against a different React Native version than the app is using.

## Drawbacks

### Transition period: supporting both CocoaPods and SPM

With CocoaPods trunk going read-only in December 2026, the migration to SPM is
necessary rather than optional. During the transition period, both build
systems must be supported in parallel. Bug fixes, new features, and build-phase
changes need to be tested against both CocoaPods and SPM until CocoaPods
support is eventually removed.

### Download size

Prebuilt xcframeworks for React Native core are compressed as tar.gz archives.
Individual library xcframeworks are typically 1–15 MB in debug mode including
dSYM bundles. Both debug and release flavors are needed, which doubles the
total. While artifacts are cached locally after the first download, CI
environments without persistent caches will re-download on every build.

### Ecosystem adoption takes time

Third-party libraries must opt in to the prebuild workflow. During the
transition period, many libraries will only support CocoaPods. Apps that depend
on these libraries cannot fully migrate to SPM until the libraries catch up.
This creates a chicken-and-egg problem that may slow adoption.

### SPM limitations require `.xcodeproj` generation

SPM does not support build script phases, `post_install` hooks, or the kind of
build-time customization that CocoaPods provides via its Podfile DSL. The
current design works around this by generating an `.xcodeproj` with explicit
build phases for JS bundling, Hermes engine copying, VFS overlay setup, and
autolinking sync. This is a known limitation of the current approach. If Apple
expands SPM's plugin API to support arbitrary script execution with file I/O
and network access, the `.xcodeproj` could be eliminated in favor of a purely
SPM-native workflow — but this is a future direction that depends on Apple's
roadmap, not something this proposal can resolve.

### User-owned `Package.swift`

The root `Package.swift` is generated once and committed. It only references
sub-packages by relative path, so React Native upgrades do not require changes
to it. However, developers who customize it (adding dependencies or targets)
must understand the generated package structure. In rare cases where the
sub-package layout changes across a major version, the root file may need
manual updates.

## Alternatives

### Compile React Native from source as SPM targets

Compiling React Native's C++/Objective-C sources from source as SPM targets is
not the default path due to the ~2000 source files and complex header layout,
which makes clean build times significantly longer. However, source
compilation support is a goal for specific use cases:

- **Debugging React Native internals** — developers investigating bugs or
  contributing fixes to React Native itself need to build from source with
  debug symbols.
- **Apps requiring source patches** — projects like Expo Go that need to modify
  React Native source code to build successfully, or apps that apply patches
  via tools like `patch-package`.

The source compilation path would reuse the same SPM package structure but
replace binary xcframework targets with source targets. This is planned as a
`--source` flag to `setup-ios-spm.js`.

### SPM build tool plugins

SPM plugins were evaluated as a way to eliminate the `.xcodeproj` (see
[SPM Plugins Assessment](spm-plugins-assessment.md) for details). The key
findings:

- **Post-build phases are impossible.** JS bundling and Hermes engine copying
  run after linking to place artifacts in the `.app` bundle. SPM has no
  post-build plugin capability — this is a deliberate design choice for build
  reproducibility.
- **Sandbox restrictions.** Build tool plugins cannot write to the source tree,
  run `node`, or access `node_modules`. Pre-build phases like autolinking sync
  require all of these.
- **No Xcode build settings.** SPM plugins do not receive `CONFIGURATION`,
  `BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR`, or other settings that the JS bundling script relies on.

A hybrid approach (some SPM plugins + some Xcode build phases) would be harder
to reason about than the current uniform approach of all Xcode build phases.
SPM plugins are not a viable alternative today.

## Adoption strategy

This proposal introduces SPM as an **additional** build system. It is not a
breaking change. CocoaPods continues to work exactly as before. The two
workflows coexist — an app can have both `Podfile` and `Package.swift` in the
same directory.

### Phase 1: React Native core (current)

SPM works for React Native core frameworks and app-local native modules
declared as `spmModules` in `react-native.config.js`. No third-party library
support. This phase validates the architecture and developer experience with
rn-tester and the helloworld template.

### Phase 2: Library ecosystem tooling

Ship the `react-native-prebuild` CLI. Library authors can prebuild and publish
xcframeworks for their libraries. The autolinking step reads `spm.xcframework`
from installed libraries and downloads artifacts automatically. Libraries
without xcframeworks fall back to `spm.source` (source compilation) or manual
`spmModules` entries.

### Phase 3: Ecosystem-wide adoption

Popular libraries ship prebuilt xcframeworks from CI. App developers get
near-zero-compilation iOS builds — only app code and codegen output are
compiled. React Native provides clear documentation and tooling
(`react-native-prebuild`) to help library authors build and publish
xcframeworks — for example, CI workflow templates and guidance on publishing to
Maven or GitHub Releases. Prebuilt xcframeworks are recommended but not
required; libraries that don't provide them fall back to source compilation.

### Migration path for existing apps

1. Run `setup-ios-spm.js --init` in the `ios/` directory.
2. Commit the generated `Package.swift` and `AppName-SPM.xcodeproj`.
3. Open the new `.xcodeproj` and build.
4. Once validated, optionally remove CocoaPods files (`Podfile`, `Pods/`,
   `.xcworkspace`).

No changes to JavaScript code, Metro configuration, or Android setup are
required.

### Upgrading React Native

After upgrading `react-native` in `package.json` and running `npm install`,
the auto-sync build phase detects the `node_modules` mtime change on the next
Xcode build and re-runs the sync step automatically. This downloads the new
version's xcframeworks, regenerates the sub-packages, and updates autolinking.
No manual edits to `Package.swift` are needed — the root `Package.swift` only
references sub-packages by relative path, and those sub-packages are fully
regenerated each run. Developers can also run `setup-ios-spm.js` manually to
trigger the update before building.

## How we teach this

### Documentation

- Add a **"Building with SPM"** guide to the React Native docs, parallel to the
  existing CocoaPods setup guide.
- Update the **"Getting Started"** guide to present SPM as an option alongside
  CocoaPods, with SPM as the recommended path for new projects once Phase 2 is
  stable.
- Add a **library author guide** explaining how to use `react-native-prebuild`
  and publish xcframeworks.

### CLI discoverability

- `setup-ios-spm.js --help` should provide clear usage instructions and
  explain each step.
- Error messages should include actionable suggestions (e.g., "Run with --init
  for first-time setup").
- The auto-sync build phase should surface warnings in Xcode's issue navigator
  when autolinking state is stale.

### Community template

- The `react-native init` template should include SPM as an option (e.g.,
  `--pm spm` flag or interactive prompt).
- The template should generate the initial `Package.swift` and `.xcodeproj` so
  that new projects work with SPM out of the box.

### Naming and terminology

- **"SPM build"** or **"Swift Package Manager build"** to distinguish from the
  CocoaPods-based workflow.
- **"xcframeworks"** when referring to the prebuilt binary artifacts.
- Avoid the term "pods" when discussing the SPM workflow to prevent confusion.

## Unresolved questions

1. **How should version compatibility be enforced?** A library's xcframework
   must be built against a compatible React Native version. Should the download
   step enforce strict version matching, accept semver-compatible ranges, or
   simply warn on mismatch?

2. **Where should library xcframeworks be hosted?** Maven Central (consistent
   with React Native core), GitHub Releases (simpler for library authors), or a
   dedicated registry (better discovery and compatibility metadata). Each has
   different trade-offs for discoverability, reliability, and maintenance
   burden.

3. **Debug symbol (dSYM) distribution.** The prebuild pipeline produces dSYM
   bundles alongside xcframeworks, but the best way to distribute and consume
   them is not yet defined. Open questions include: should dSYMs be downloaded
   alongside xcframeworks automatically or on demand? How should they integrate
   with crash reporting services (Sentry, Crashlytics) that need dSYM UUIDs
   for symbolication? Should the download step place dSYMs in a location that
   Xcode's archive workflow picks up automatically?

4. **How should library authors validate SPM compatibility?** A validation
   command (`react-native-prebuild --validate`) could verify that a library's
   sources compile as an SPM target without producing a full release artifact.
   This would be useful for CI checks on pull requests.

5. **Hardening `--init` for existing projects.** Running `--init` on a project
   that already has `Package.swift` or `.xcodeproj` should detect existing
   files and avoid overwriting user modifications. The current `.xcodeproj`
   generation uses a simple template-based approach; adopting a proper Xcode
   project parser/generator (e.g., `@bacons/xcode`) would enable safer
   incremental updates — reading the existing project, merging changes, and
   writing back without losing manual edits. This is planned work for
   production readiness.

6. **Auto-sync failure visibility.** The sync build phase currently emits
   `warning:` and exits 0 on failure, which means a broken autolinking state
   can persist silently across builds. Planned improvements include a strict
   mode (e.g., `RN_SPM_STRICT_SYNC=1` that exits non-zero on failure) and
   generating a `#warning` directive in a source file when sync fails, so
   Xcode surfaces the issue in the issue navigator even when build log
   warnings are missed.

7. **Monorepo and package manager compatibility.** The auto-sync build phase
   uses `node_modules` mtime to detect dependency changes. This has been
   tested with npm in the React Native monorepo but not yet with Yarn
   workspaces (hoisted or PnP), pnpm (symlinked `node_modules`), or Bun.
   These package managers structure `node_modules` differently and may require
   adjustments to the mtime detection logic. Validating and fixing
   compatibility across package managers is planned work.
