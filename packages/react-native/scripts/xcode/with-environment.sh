# This script is used to source in Xcode the environment settings required to run properly.
#Â The script first sources the base `.xcode.env` file.
# Then it sources the `.xcode.env.local` file if present, to override some local config
# Finally, it will execute the command passed i input if any.
#
# USAGE:
# ./with-environment.sh command

# Start with a default
NODE_BINARY=$(command -v node || echo "")
export NODE_BINARY

# Override the default with the global environment
ENV_PATH="$PODS_ROOT/../.xcode.env"
if [ -f "$ENV_PATH" ]; then
    source "$ENV_PATH"
fi

# Override the global with the local environment
LOCAL_ENV_PATH="${ENV_PATH}.local"
if [ -f "$LOCAL_ENV_PATH" ]; then
    source "$LOCAL_ENV_PATH"
fi

# Check whether NODE_BINARY has been properly set, otherwise help the users with a meaningful error.
if [ -n "$NODE_BINARY" ]; then
    echo "Node found at: ${NODE_BINARY}"
