#Â This file contains the utilities required to mock properly the
# usage of the `pod` function.
#
# To use this file, just add `require_relative "path/to/podSpy.rb"` to your test file.
#
# Remember to invoke `podSpy_cleanUp` in your setup/teardown method, to start from a clean situation.
#
# Whenever your ruby script uses the `pod` function, the invocation is recorded in the `$podInvocation` global
# variable. A $podInvocationCount counter is increased as well.
#
# You can assert against these variables to check:
# * The `pod` function has been invoked X times: `assert_equal(X, $podInvocationCount)`
# * A specific pod has been installed: `assert_equal("15.4.6", $podInvocation["MyPod"][:version])`
