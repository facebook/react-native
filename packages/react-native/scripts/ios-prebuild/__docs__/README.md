# iOS Prebuild Scripts

This directory contains scripts for prebuilding React Native itself into
XCFrameworks for iOS and related platforms.

## Overview

These scripts automate the process of building React Native as a Swift Package
and packaging it into XCFrameworks that can be distributed and consumed by iOS
applications. The build process creates optimized frameworks for multiple
architectures and platforms.

## Purpose

The prebuild scripts are used to:

- Build React Native itself (not its dependencies) as XCFrameworks
- Create distributable binaries for iOS, iOS Simulator, Catalyst, Vision, and
  visionOS platforms
- Support both Debug and Release build configurations
- Generate Debug Symbol (dSYM) files for debugging
- Enable library evolution and module stability for Swift packages

## Usage

Run the prebuild script from the command line:

```bash
cd packages/react-native
node scripts/ios-prebuild
```

If no options are passed, the script executes all the steps in this order:

- setup build for all platforms and flavors
- compose xcframeworks
- sign (if an identity is passed)

| `--identity`  | `-i`  | string  | -                                          | Specify the code signing identity to use for signing the frameworks |
| `--help`      | -     | boolean | -                                          | Show help information                                               |

### Output Structure

The build produces:

- XCFrameworks in the specified output directory
- Debug symbols (dSYM files) for debugging
- Build products organized by platform and configuration

## Architecture

The build system consists of several components:

### `cli.js`

The main entry point that orchestrates the build process. It:

- Parses command-line arguments
- Validates build parameters
- Coordinates the build, archiving, and XCFramework creation steps

### `build.js`

Handles the Swift Package build process. It:

- Executes `xcodebuild` commands with appropriate flags
- Builds for specific platforms and build types (Debug/Release)
- Locates and validates the generated framework artifacts
- Uses build settings like `BUILD_LIBRARY_FOR_DISTRIBUTION=YES` for binary
  compatibility

### `types.js`

Defines TypeScript/Flow type definitions for:

- `BuildFlavor`: Debug or Release configurations
- `Destination`: Target platforms (iOS, iOS Simulator, Catalyst, Vision,
  visionOS)
- `ArchiveOptions`: Configuration options for the build process

### `utils.js`

Provides utility functions including:

- Logging functionality with prefixed output
- Common helper functions used across scripts

## Build Flags

The build process uses specific `xcodebuild` flags:

- `BUILD_LIBRARY_FOR_DISTRIBUTION=YES`: Enables module stability
- `SKIP_INSTALL=NO`: Ensures frameworks are properly installed
- `DEBUG_INFORMATION_FORMAT="dwarf-with-dsym"`: Generates debug symbols
- `OTHER_SWIFT_FLAGS="-no-verify-emitted-module-interface"`: Skips interface
  verification (useful for React Native modules due to the header structure not
  beeing modular)

## Notes

- These scripts build React Native itself, not third-party dependencies
- The build process requires significant disk space for derived data
- Build times vary depending on the target platform and configuration
- XCFrameworks support multiple architectures in a single bundle

## Known Issues

The generated XCFrameworks currently use CocoaPods-style header structures
rather than standard framework header conventions. This may cause modularity
issues when:

- Consuming the XCFrameworks in projects that expect standard framework headers
- Building dependent frameworks that rely on proper module boundaries
- Integrating with Swift Package Manager projects expecting modular headers

## Integrating in your project with Cocoapods

For consuming, debugging or troubleshooting when using Cocoapods scripts, you
can use the following environment variables:

- `RCT_USE_PREBUILT_RNCORE`: If set to 1, it will use the release tarball from
  Maven instead of building from source.
- `RCT_TESTONLY_RNCORE_TARBALL_PATH`: **TEST ONLY** If set, it will use a local
  tarball of RNCore if it exists.
- `RCT_TESTONLY_RNCORE_VERSION`: **TEST ONLY** If set, it will override the
  version of RNCore to be used.
- `RCT_SYMBOLICATE_PREBUILT_FRAMEWORKS`: If set to 1, it will download the dSYMs
  for the prebuilt RNCore frameworks and install these in the framework folders
