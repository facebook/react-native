@facebook-github-bot stack-overflow
comment Hey {issue_author}, thanks for posting this! {author} tells me this issue looks like a question that would be best asked on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/react-native). Stack Overflow is amazing for Q&A: it has a reputation system, voting, the ability to mark a question as answered. Because of the reputation system it is likely the community will see and answer your question there. This also helps us use the GitHub bug tracker for bugs only.<br/><br/><sub>[How to Contribute](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/contributing.html#bugs) • [What to Expect from Maintainers](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/maintainers.html#handling-issues)</sub>

@facebook-github-bot large-pr
comment Thank you for your contribution. Unfortunately, this pull request seems relatively large.<br/><br/>In order to reduce the load on maintainers, it would be valuable if you could [split this into small, targeted PRs that changed one thing at a time](https://graysonkoonce.com/stacked-pull-requests-keeping-github-diffs-small/).<br/><br/>If doing this requires more than a few pull requests, please open (or update) an issue specifying your goal and the different steps you will take in your PRs. This will ensure maintainers have context on the relationship between the PRs.<br/><br/>If this is a codemod or other formatting change that is simple but inherently touches many files, please comment on this and let us know and we will reopen the PR.

@facebook-github-bot cannot-repro
comment Thanks for opening the issue! It does not appear like a community member will be able to reliably reproduce this issue. This may be for several reasons; perhaps it affects a particular app but a minimal repro has not been provided, or the issue may be sporadic. As it happens, we need a concrete set of steps that can demonstrably reproduce the issue as this will allow your fellow community members to validate a fix. We'll close the issue for now, but feel free to submit a new issue once you're able to reliably reproduce the issue locally. Thanks for your understanding!<br/><br/><sub>[How to Contribute](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/contributing.html#bugs) • [What to Expect from Maintainers](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/maintainers.html#handling-issues)</sub>

@facebook-github-bot feature
comment Hey {issue_author}! Thanks for opening the issue, however it looks like a feature request. As noted in the [Issue template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/facebook/react-native/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) we'd like to use the GitHub issues to track bugs only. Can you implement the feature as a standalone npm module? If not, consider sending a pull request or a creating an entry on [Canny](https://react-native.canny.io/feature-requests/). It has a voting system and if the feature gets upvoted enough it might get implemented. Closing this now, thanks for understanding!<br/><br/><sub>[How to Contribute](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/contributing.html#bugs) • [What to Expect from Maintainers](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/maintainers.html#handling-issues)</sub>
