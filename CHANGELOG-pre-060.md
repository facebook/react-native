# Changelog (pre 0.60)

This file contains all changelogs for releases in the pre-0.60 range. Please check out the other `CHANGELOG-*.md` files for newer versions.

## v0.59.10

This is likely the last patch release for version 59 of React Native for the foreseeable future: it contains an important Android side update for the JavaScript Core, to prevent a great number of crashes mostly related to Samsung devices - thanks to [@Kudo](https://github.com/Kudo) for his work on fixing this via [557989a86f](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/557989a86f8730113393ed229927d607a478e524)!

Thanks everyone who participated in the [discussion](https://github.com/react-native-community/releases/issues/127).

## v0.59.9

This is a patch fix release addressing a couple ScrollView regressions, and "future-proof" RN 59 from crashes caused by upgrading Gradle (now can support up to 5.4.1 & 3.4.0 for the plugin) and Xcode 11 Beta 1. You can upgrade to this version without upgrading your tooling.

Thanks everyone who contributed code or participated in the [discussion](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-releases/issues/124) for cherry-picking commits. You can participate to the conversation for the next patch release in the dedicated [issue](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-releases/issues/127).

### Changed

- If `isInteraction` is not specified in the config, it would always default to `true` which would block interactions like VirtualizedList updates. This is generally not what you want with useNativeDriver since the animation won't be interrupted by JS. If something does end up interfering with an animation and causes frame drops, `isInteraction` can be set manually.

## v0.58.0

Welcome to first stable release of React Native of 2019!
There are a number of significant changes in this version, and we'd like to especially draw your attention to them:

- [Modernizing](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/21581) and [strengthening flow types](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/22100) for core components
- Breaking changes to `ScrollView`, `CameraRollView`, and `SwipeableRow` that make it no longer bound to the component instance in certain methods
- Support for mutual TLS in WebKit
- Asset serving from directories besides `/assets`
- Numerous crash fixes and resolutions for unexpected behavior

Aside from those:

- if you are an iOS developer, you'll need to manually link `JavaScriptCore.framework` when upgrading; this can be done via Xcode, and following the steps shown [here](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/c09cd42747364b498efa7c82fcb73978ba076eae/687474703a2f2f646f63732e6f6e656d6f62696c6573646b2e616f6c2e636f6d2f696f732d61642d73646b2f616464696e672d6672616d65776f726b732e706e67).

- Android developers, please note that Android's target SDK 27 is supported. Work is still underway to land target SDK 28 support, and it will come soon.

Thanks to those who gave feedback during the [release candidate phase](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-releases/issues/41). If you're interested in helping evaluate our next release (0.59), subscribe to the dedicated issue [here](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-releases/issues/79).

### Added

- Add support for `publicPath` to enable serving static assets from different locations ([0b314960aa](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/0b314960aa34c71fc731bac9c1f2b48f3223c5cb) by [@gdborton](https://github.com/gdborton))
- Add **TouchableBounce** now has a simple `bounce()` function that can be used to trigger a bounce without callbacks ([7fe3f90156](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/7fe3f90156e879fe53665efb5a90ba3a711475fa))

#### Android specific

- Bundler server host can now be set using Android System Properties, making for easier debugging across multiple apps or app installs `adb shell setprop metro.host` ([e02a154787](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/e02a154787274be1da3632cb1412554cbd53928b) by [@stepanhruda](https://github.com/stepanhruda))
- Native Modules can now reject a promise with an additional `WritableMap` arg for extra properties (`userInfo`). See the interface defined in [`Promise.java`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/60b3942/ReactAndroid/src/main/java/com/facebook/react/bridge/Promise.java) for available methods. This is accessible in JavaScript as `Error.userInfo`. This is to match iOS's existing `Error.userInfo` behavior. See PR for examples. (#20940 by @Salakar)
- Native Modules now expose a `nativeStackAndroid` property to promises rejected with an Exception/Throwable - making native error stacks available inside Javascript: `Error.nativeStackAndroid`. This is to match iOS's existing `Error.nativeStackIOS` support. See PR for examples. (#20940 by @Salakar)

#### iOS specific

- Add `moduleForName: lazilyLoadIfNecessary` to **RCTBridge.h** to lookup modules by name and force load them, plus various improvements to LazyLoading ([d7a0c44590](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/d7a0c44590bcf3fb9d055aeae3391d5bcd7e21be), [6534718a18](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/6534718a1898aa472e255d2aa9a0a6cae305619a), [d7865ebde8](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/d7865ebde879983b355d6f6e64232e4bd264081d), [04ea9762e2](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/04ea9762e2013dcebf9f8a51d8974fa799e41cd5), [1f394fa673](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/1f394fa673a876753fdc9ac2cb86a4d4a58cd8cd), [80f92adf1f](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/80f92adf1f35e74ee6db0b2f445cc851463059cf), and [81b74ec1ed](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/81b74ec1ed3792c0b406c30b0a1c01219a2d6243) by [@dshahidehpour](https://github.com/dshahidehpour), [@fkgozali](https://github.com/fkgozali), and [@mmmulani](https://github.com/mmmulani))

#### Breaking Changes 💥

- Public methods of components converted to ES6 classes are no longer bound to their component instance. For `ScrollView`, the affected methods are `setNativeProps`, `getScrollResponder`, `getScrollableNode`, `getInnerViewNode`, `scrollTo`, `scrollToEnd`, `scrollWithoutAnimationTo`, and `flashScrollIndicators`. For `CameraRollView`, the affected methods are: `rendererChanged`. For `SwipeableRow`, the affected methods are: `close`. Therefore, it is no longer safe to pass these method by reference as callbacks to functions. Auto-binding methods to component instances was a behaviour of `createReactClass` that we decided to not preserve when switching over to ES6 classes. (you can refer to [this example](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-releases/issues/81#issuecomment-459252692))
- Native Modules in Android now require `@ReactModule` annotations to access `.getNativeModule` method on the `ReactContext`. This is how your updated Native Module should look like:

  ```diff
  // CustomModule.java

  // ...
  +  import com.facebook.react.module.annotations.ReactModule;

  +  @ReactModule(name="CustomBridge")
  public class CustomModule extends ReactContextBaseJavaModule {
    // ...

    @Override
    public String getName() {
        return "CustomBridge";
    }

    // ...
  }
  ```

### Known issues

It is possible that you'll face an AAPT error regarding missing resources, [here](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite-andross/issues/244) is an example of this error, in this case, you should try to update the build tools versions to `buildToolsVersion = "28.0.2"` in your android/build.gradle file. If you maintain a react-native library which uses native code you should avoid using hardcoded versions of the build tools and use the packaged version numbers, here is an example you can [follow](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-linear-gradient/blob/master/android/build.gradle)

## v0.57.8

### Known issues

There are a few issues that don't have a finalized solution (as it happens for 0.x projects). In particular:

- when using Xcode 10 and `react-native init`, your build may fail due to third-party build steps ([#20774](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/20774)). There is a [commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/b44c5ae92eb08125d466cf151cb804dabfbbc690) we are planning to cherry pick in a future release that should help - in the meantime, you should be able to run these commands from the project folder to fix the issue (you should need to do it only once per project):

  ```bash
  cd node_modules/react-native
  scripts/ios-install-third-party.sh
  cd third-party/glog-0.3.5/
  ../../scripts/ios-configure-glog.sh
  ```

- React `16.6.0` works for the most part, aside from the Context API (check [this issue](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/21975)) - and if you are eager to test the new React Hooks you will have to be patient, as they are not production ready and `16.7.alpha` is **not** yet [supported](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/21967) by React Native.

## v0.57.3

**NOTE WELL**: when you upgrade to this version you **NEED** to upgrade `react` and `react-test-renderer` to version `"16.6.0-alpha.8af6728"`. Also, please check the _Known issues_ section below, especially if you are using Xcode 10.

## v0.57.0

Welcome to the 0.57 release of React Native! This release addresses a number of issues and has some exciting improvements. We again skipped a monthly release, focused on quality by extending the release candidate phase, and let some upstream packages reach stable for inclusion.

This release includes [599 commits by 73 different contributors](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/compare/0.56-stable...0.57-stable)! In response to feedback, we've prepared a changelog that contains only user-impacting changes. Please share your input and let us know how we can make this even more useful, and as always [let us know](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-releases/issues/34) if you have any feedback on this process.

### Highlights

#### New features

- Accessibility APIs now support accessibility hints, inverted colors, and easier usage of defining the element's role and states; read more at [@ziqichen6's excellent blog post](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2018/08/13/react-native-accessibility-updates)
- On iOS, `WKWebView` can now be used within the `WebView` component; read more at [@rsnara's awesome blog post](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2018/08/27/wkwebview)
- Better support for out-of-tree platforms. For details, please refer to [the discussion](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/21) that the community used to get this up and running (there will be a new page in the docs dedicated to it too) - huge props to @empyrical for working on this!

#### Tooling updates

- Android tooling has been updated to match newer configuration requirements (SDK 27, gradle 4.4, and support library 27); building with Android plugin 3.2 doesn't work due to the gradle scripts, so **please** stay on Android Studio 3.1 for now
- Support Babel 7 stable landed! Be sure to read [here](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/typescript/2018/08/27/typescript-and-babel-7/) about using TypeScript and check out the [Babel 7 migration guide](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/next/v7-migration) for help migrating.
- Metro has been upgraded (with Babel 7 and better transformer support), and in the next major release we plan on having two new features (ram bundles and inline requires) optional for you all to use - you can read how it will happen [here](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/blob/master/core-meetings/2018-09-metro-meeting.md); moreover, if you have a custom packager config, we recommend you read also the "updating to this version" section.
- Flow, React, and related packages have also been updated; this includes [working support](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/5491c3f942430982ce9cb6140ed1733879ed3d1d) for the [React Profiler](https://react.dev/blog/2018/09/10/introducing-the-react-profiler.html).

#### The Slimmening is happening

As mentioned a few times in the past, the core team is reviewing the repository to trim it to the base React Native features in order to make the whole ecosystem more maintainable (by using a _divide-et-impera_ approach, the community will move faster and enable pull requests to be reviewed and merged quicker). This change requires extracting some components into their own separate repos and removing old, unused code ([details here](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/6)).

0.57 is **not** directly affected by any changes, but we want you to know that:

- `WebView` will be moved to its own repo at [react-native-community/react-native-webview](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-webview). There is already a base implementation there. Help us out by giving that a try, and expect that `WebView` will be deprecated soon
- `NavigatorIOS` will be **fully** removed from the main codebase starting 0.58.0 (via [this commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/0df92afc1caf96100013935d50bdde359b688658)); it is now deprecated

### Updating to this version

1. Upgrade the version of React Native in the `package.json` from `0.56.0` to `0.57.0`, and the React version to `16.5`
2. Change the babel-preset dependency from `"babel-preset-react-native": "^5",` to `"metro-react-native-babel-preset": "^0.45.0",`, then change the `.babelrc` configuration to:

   ```JSON
     {
       "presets": ["module:metro-react-native-babel-preset"]
     }
   ```

3. Ensure that you have all the babel dependencies to version `^7.0.0` (you may also need to add `"babel-core": "7.0.0-bridge.0"` as a yarn resolution to ensure retro-compatibility). The Babel team has released a tool, [babel-upgrade](https://github.com/babel/babel-upgrade), that should help you in this migration.
4. Upgrading android gradle version to 4.4
   1. In your project's `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` file, change the `distributionUrl` to `https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-4.4-all.zip`
   2. In `android/build.gradle` file add `google()` right above `jcenter()` in both `buildscript` and `allprojects` repositories. Then change Android build tools to version 3.1.4 `classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.1.4'`
   3. In `android/app/build.gradle` file update all your `compile` statements to be `implementation`, e.g. `implementation 'com.facebook.fresco:animated-gif:1.10.0'`
   4. Do note that when running your app from within Android Studio, you may encounter `Missing Byte Code` errors. This is due to [a known issue](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/72811718) with version 3.1.x of the android tools plugin. You'll need to disable Instant Run to get past this error.
5. If you have a custom packager configuration via `rn-cli.config.js`, you probably need to update it to work with the updated Metro configuration structure (for full detail refer to Metro's [documentation](https://facebook.github.io/metro/docs/en/configuration)); here are some commonly encountered changes to `rn-cli.config.js`:

   ```diff
   -const blacklist = require('metro/src/blacklist')
   +const blacklist = require('metro-config/src/defaults/blacklist')

   // ...

   module.exports = {
   +  watchFolders: alternateRoots,
   +  resolver: {
   +    blacklistRE: blacklist
   +  },
   +  transformer: {
   +    babelTransformerPath: require.resolve('./scripts/transformer.js'),
   +  },
   -  getProjectRoots() {
   -    return [
   -      path.resolve(__dirname),
   -    ].concat(alternateRoots)
   -  },
   -  getBlacklistRE() {
   -    return blacklist;
   -  },
   -  transformModulePath: require.resolve('./scripts/transformer.js'),
   }
   ```

6. Run `yarn` to ensure that all the new dependencies have been installed

- In the CLI, don't override `metro.config.js` settings ([c5297c75cb](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/c5297c75cb6da58a241c8f91b0d2fefbc5835a46) by [@rozele](https://github.com/rozele))

#### Breaking Changes

- Public methods of Image (`blur`, `focus`, `measure`, `measureInWindow`, `measureLayout`, `setNativeProps`) are no longer bound to the image component instance. Therefore, it is unsafe to pass these methods by reference (i.e: as callbacks) to functions. So, things like `setTimeout(this._imgRef.focus, 1000)` will no longer work. Please instead do: `setTimout(() => this._imgRef.focus(), 1000)`.

#### Android specific changes

- `Image` source without a uri now returns null ([28c7ccf785](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/28c7ccf785132458fce32c234ce777a6fe475c93) by [@himabindugadupudi](https://github.com/himabindugadupudi))

## v0.56.0

Welcome to the June 2018 release of React Native!
Over 60 contributors made [821 commits](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/compare/0.55-stable...0.56-stable) since March - and we are extremely grateful to every single one of you.

As you'll see in a second, this new version has some important **breaking changes** that required a lot of extra efforts to bring to a stable 0.56. This was the main reason behind skipping April and May from the monthly release cycle, but looking forward we are planning on going back to do a rollout every month.

### Highlights

#### React Native now uses **Babel 7**

When upgrading to 0.56, make sure to bump your `babel-preset-react-native` `package.json` dependency to `5.0.2` or newer (but still as _fixed_ value).

React Native library authors will need to update their libraries to make use of the updated Babel preset as Babel 7 is **not** backwards compatible.

If you have issues upgrading to Babel 7, please double check the [related documentation](https://new.babeljs.io/docs/en/next/v7-migration.html#versioning-dependencies-blog-2017-12-27-nearing-the-70-releasehtml-peer-dependencies-integrations), in particular the sections related to _Package Renames_ and _Scoped Packages_.

The [`babel-bridge`](https://github.com/babel/babel-bridge) library may be used if you need to use libraries that have not yet upgraded to Babel 7. You may also enforce the Babel 7 dependency via tools like [yarn resolutions](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/selective-version-resolutions/). Overall, you need to ensure all the `@babel/*` deps are fixed at version `7.0.0-beta.47`.

#### **Node 8** is now the minimum required version

Trailing commas are now allowed.

#### **iOS 9** is now the minimum required version

Any device that can run iOS 8, can upgrade to iOS 9. Developers who support iOS 8 in their apps may continue doing so as this is a Xcode-level setting (`IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`).

#### **Xcode 9** is now the minimum required version

We recommend using Xcode 9.4 as that is what we use to run our tests.

#### **Android** projects are now compiled using the _Android 26 SDK_

The target API level is left unchanged in this release.

Starting August 2018, new apps submitted to the Play Store will need to target API 26 as a minimum. You can now opt your project in to use API 26 (or newer) as the target. Please let us know about any issues, as we'd like to finalize support for Android API 26 by the time `0.57.0` is released.

#### `WebView` will only load http(s) URLs by default

Geolocation is disabled by default.

#### Consistently Throw for `<Text><View /></Text>`

Removes a pitfall that people may run into when releasing an app for Android if the bulk of the testing has been performed on iOS only. Nesting a `<View>` within a `<Text>` component (e.g. `<Text><View /></Text>`) is unsupported on Android, but using this pattern on iOS has not thrown errors in the past. With this release, nesting a `<View>` inside a `<Text>` will now throw an error on iOS in order to reduce the parity gap between the platforms.

#### Flow improvements, migrating away from PropTypes

Added Flow types for several components.

We're migrating away from PropTypes and runtime checks and instead relying on **Flow**. You'll notice many improvements related to Flow in this release.

- Fix project settings warnings on newer Xcode versions, remove unnecessary console logging.
- Modernized `YellowBox`.
  Sort warnings by recency, group warnings by format string, present stack traces, show status of loading source maps, support inspecting each occurrence of a warning, and bug fixes.
- Prettier files!
- Lots of bug fixes.

#### State of React Native

Heads-up: the Facebook internal team is [currently working on a rewrite of some core architecture pieces](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2018/06/14/state-of-react-native-2018). This is a **work in progress** and we do not expect it to be ready for use in open source quite yet, but we felt the need to let you know what those commits mentioning Fabric are about.

- Tightening types for `View` and `VirtualizedList` ([5035af80ec](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/5035af80ecddb44e2a8444780f25f336b760bf32))

- _[BREAKING]_ `requireNativeComponent`'s signature has been simplified to only take extraOptions ([820673e707](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/820673e7076b5906ba50e09e40fb9a32cf500c1b), [b549e364e0](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/b549e364e0025e0e1b4005f04a9de2d767006da1), [28d37781c6](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/28d37781c6589574de1113bd12077f6d54053ffb), [1c90a2b47b](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/1c90a2b47b420a4b6aa16a55a344cc08f0eacbe3), and [1ab7d49c2d](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/1ab7d49c2df5673dd214eb8a9b7fd3defb0ff857) by [@yungsters](https://github.com/yungsters))

#### Breaking Changes

- Public methods of Text (`blur`, `focus`, `measure`, `measureInWindow`, `measureLayout`, `setNativeProps`) are no longer bound to the text component instance. It is therefore unsafe to pass these methods by reference (i.e: as callbacks) to functions. So, things like `setTimeout(this._txtRef.focus, 1000)` will no longer work. Please instead do: `setTimeout(() => this._txtRef.focus(), 1000)`.

### Known issues

During the RC testing of this version, a few issues that have been opened don't have yet a finalized solution ( [19827](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/19827), [19763](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/19763), [19859](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/19859), [19955](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/19955) ).

## v0.54.0

Welcome to the February 2018 release of React Native! This release includes work done by the React Native team and the community in January, and there are some big changes here after the holidays. Thanks for 270 commits from 87 contributors, you all are great! Here are a few highlights from the release:

- Long awaited **Blob** changes: upload, download, fetch locally, and more
- Sticky headers now work on inverted Lists
- Update to the newest React, which deprecated some lifecycle methods and added new ones – expect Yellowbox until React Native is updated
- `Space-evenly` is now there (sorry for the confusion with 0.52's release notes)
- A lot of under-the-covers work on Yoga, iOS's **Text** and **TextInput**, and a ton of other areas
- Multiple crash fixes

The changelog is arranged by the customary added, removed, changed, and fixed plus internal; the changes are also organized by platform.

## v0.52.0

> This changelog has been prepared by Ryan Turner (@turnrye) - thank you for
> your time and making such a detailed changelog 🔥🔥

This release had a lot of work around the bundler and packager, a ton of
bugfixes, and updates to many of React Native's dependencies. Lots of
under-the-hood work was done as well to improve the layout engine. Happy new
year!
